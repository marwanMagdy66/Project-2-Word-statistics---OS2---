per file/directory, longest word, shortest word, number of “is”, “are” and “you”).
- The program should have a simple GUI
- The input of the program is a directory
o It should then search for all text files that reside in that directory
o There should be an option to check for text files in subdirectories 
- While the program is processing text files, it should display them (file name)
