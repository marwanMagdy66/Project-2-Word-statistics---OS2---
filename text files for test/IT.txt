The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) is one of th
e largest and best-known cuttlefish species. It is nati'
ve to the Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, and Baltic Sea, with so
me subspecies proposed in South Africa. It lives on sand and mud seabed'
s and can tolerate brackish water. The common cuttlefish is a migratory ]
species, spending the summer and spring inshore for spawning and then

 moving to depths of 100 to 200 metres (330 to 660 ft) during autumn 
and winter. It has a mantle of up to 49 centimetres (19 in), with a mass 
of 4 kilograms (8.8 lb). Cuttlefish have strong camouflaging abili
ties, enabled by a variety of specialized cells: pigmented chromatophore

 organs, light-scattering leucophores, and structurally reflecting iridoph
ores in their skin. This common cuttlefish was pho
tographed in Arrábida Natural Park, Portugal.

Lever House is at 390 Park Avenue, on the western sidewalk between 53rd Street and 54th Street, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City.[2][3][4] The land lot has a frontage of 200 feet (61 m) on Park Avenue, 192 feet (59 m) on 54th Street, and 155 feet (47 m) on 53rd Street, giving the lot a slight "L"-shape.[2][5][6] The lot has an area of 34,844 square feet (3,237.1 m2).[2][7] The Banco Santander building on 53rd Street abuts Lever House to the west,[8][9] and the DuMont Building and Hotel Elysée on 54th Street occupy the same city block. Other nearby buildings include 399 Park Avenue directly across Park Avenue to the east; the Seagram Building diagonally across Park Avenue and 53rd Street to the southeast; and the CBS Studio Building, Park Avenue Plaza, and Racquet and Tennis Club Building across 53rd Street to the south.[2] An entrance to the New York City Subway's Fifth Avenue/53rd Street station, served by the E, ​F, and <F> trains, is less than a block west along 53rd Street.[10]

The site, which was part of Charles McEvers's farm in the early 19th century, had been developed by the 1870s with four- and five-story row houses.[11][12] By the late 19th century, the Park Avenue railroad line ran in an open-cut in the middle of Park Avenue. The line was covered with the construction of Grand Central Terminal in the early 20th century, spurring development in the surrounding area, which was known as Terminal City.[13][14] The adjacent stretch of Park Avenue became a wealthy neighborhood with upscale apartments. Twenty-two rowhouses on 53rd and 54th Streets, owned by Robert Walton Goelet, formerly stood on Lever House's site.[11] Twenty of these were demolished in 1936 and replaced by the Art Deco Normandie Theater, as well as a one-story "taxpayer" building that was intended to preserve the site for future development. The two rowhouses at 62 and 64 East 54th Street remained standing
